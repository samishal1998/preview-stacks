# Changelog

## 0.1.1 — 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- **`pstack build-image`** — a globally-installed pstack could not produce the control image
  `pstack init` requires. The package ships only `dist/`, so there was no Dockerfile to build from
  and no registry to pull from, and `init` deliberately does not pull: the install was a dead end
  whose only escape was cloning the source. `build-image` assembles a build context from the
  installed package (the bundle *is* the whole application) and tags `pstack:local`, the same
  default `PSTACK_IMAGE` uses — so `build-image` then `init` need no flags.
- `init`'s precondition hint now names `pstack build-image` rather than telling the operator to
  clone the repository.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-28

First release. Declarative lifecycle for ephemeral per-PR preview stacks.

### Core

- **`preview.yml` spec** — a stack identity plus ordered **isolation axes**, each with up to four
  hooks (`up`, `assert_live`, `down`, `assert_gone`). Axes provision in declaration order and
  destroy in reverse.
- **Leak verification** — `down` is best-effort (aborting halfway leaves more garbage), `verify` is
  strict and exits **2** when a resource survived teardown. Axes without `assert_gone` report
  `unverifiable` rather than passing silently.
- **Interpolation happens once**, at parse time. An undefined variable is a hard error, because
  `pr-${PR}` with `PR` unset silently becomes `pr-` — shared by every PR.
- **Compose integration** — `up` enables the selected profiles; `down` enables **every** profile,
  which is what stops one dead `<stack>_default` network accumulating per PR.
- **Assert linting** in `pstack validate` — flags a bare `! <probe>` with no reachability guard
  (it reports "gone" when the probe itself fails), `|| true` inside an assert, and any axis with
  `up` but no `assert_gone`.

### CLI

`pstack up | down | verify | status | validate | serve`, with `--dry-run`, `--set K=V`,
`--no-verify`, `-v/-q`. Exit codes: `0` ok · `1` failed · `2` leaked · `3` bad spec/usage.

### API + UI

- `pstack serve` — HTTP API over the same core. Mutating routes are asynchronous (`202` + job id,
  poll or subscribe to SSE) because `up`/`down` take minutes. One job per stack; a concurrent
  request gets `409`.
- Two security guards: a bearer token (`PSTACK_TOKEN`) on mutating routes, and a refusal to bind
  anything but loopback when no token is set.
- A single-file Vue 3 UI (no build step) for submitting, monitoring and tearing down stacks.

### Docs

`README.md` (design), `docs/usage.md` (task guide), `docs/bootstrap.md` (build a host from
scratch — Hetzner + cloud-init), `AGENTS.md` (working on this codebase), `skills/pstack/` (a skill
teaching an agent to use pstack).

### Distribution

Installs globally as a **bundle**, not source: `bun add -g @samyx/preview-stacks`. The published
tarball is 8 files / 0.36 MB — `dist/cli.js` (~74 KB) plus `dist/index.js` for embedding, with the
UI and control-stack template inlined as text imports. No source, docs, examples or skills ship.
Not a compiled executable: that would bake the Bun runtime in per platform (~60 MB each).

### TLS

**HTTP-01 is the default** — `pstack init --domain … --acme-email …` needs no DNS credential at all;
Traefik answers on port 80 (which must be reachable). It cannot issue wildcards, so every hostname
gets its own certificate: with Let's Encrypt's ~50 new certs per registered domain per week and ~3
surfaces per PR, that is roughly 16 new PRs/week, and a preview URL is not valid until its container
exists. `--challenge dns01 --dns-provider <code>` issues one wildcard instead, lifting both limits at
the cost of a DNS credential. Note the rules invert: under HTTP-01 each per-PR router needs
`tls.certresolver`; under DNS-01 exactly one always-on router requests the wildcard and the rest must
have `tls=true` only.

### Hostnames

`control.<domain>` (UI), `api.<domain>` (API), `<service>.<domain>` (a shared service), and
`<surface>-pr-<n>.<domain>` per preview. Both control and api routers point at one container and the
UI calls the API with relative paths, so it is same-origin and needs no CORS.

### Known limitations

- **Bun-only** (`Bun.serve`/`file`/`YAML`/`spawn`). Not a Node package.
- `PSTACK_IMAGE` defaults to `pstack:local`, which does not exist on a fresh host — build it from the
  repo (`docker build -t pstack:local .`) or point it at a registry you can pull.
- **Not multi-tenant, not a sandbox.** Hooks are shell strings at CI trust level.
- **No memory isolation** — set `mem_limit` per service yourself; one greedy heap can OOM every
  stack on a shared host.
- The spec has not yet been proven against a second, independent project.
